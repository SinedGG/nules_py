The history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and techniques and is similar to the history of humanity. Emerging from the use of basic tools by early humans, the modern discipline of technology seeks to improve the understanding and integration of technological advances into society. The earliest and simplest forms of technology began with the use of stone tools approximately 2.5 million years ago. This marked the start of the Stone Age, a period characterized by the use of various stone tools to help early humans hunt, gather food, and protect themselves from predators. The subsequent technological revolutions, such as the invention of the wheel, the discovery of fire, and the development of agriculture, significantly influenced the course of human history.

As civilizations progressed, so too did the complexity and utility of the tools they developed. The Bronze Age saw the creation of metal tools, which allowed for more efficient farming and the establishment of permanent settlements. The Iron Age followed, bringing about even stronger tools and weapons, further solidifying human advancement. The Middle Ages introduced innovations such as the printing press and the mechanical clock, which greatly impacted communication and the measurement of time. In the modern era, the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent technological revolutions have continued to shape the world in ways previously unimaginable.
